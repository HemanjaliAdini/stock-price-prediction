Stock price prediction has always attracted people interested in investing in share
market and stock exchanges because of the direct financial benefits. It is also an
important research topic in finance. Prediction of stock market returns is a very complex
issue depends on so many factors such company financial status and national policy
etc. These days stock prices are affected due to many reasons like company related
news, political, social economical conditions and natural disasters.
A lot of studies were performed for the prediction of stock index values as well as daily
direction of change in the index. So many models were developed for predicting the
future price of stocks but each one has its own short comings. Advanced intelligent
techniques ranging from pure mathematical models and expert systems to neural
networks have also been used by financial institutions. In this project it is used to predict
the stock prices using auto regressive model. The auto regression model is used
because of its simplicity and wide acceptability. Study is conducted on the effectiveness
of auto regressive model. The Moore and Penrose technique is used to estimate the
coefficients of the regression equation. We have also studied accuracy of the prediction
by comparing the predicted values with the actual values over a period of time.
